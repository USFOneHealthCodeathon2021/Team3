code to download and massage data, run models, and produce visuals for inclusion in the shiny app

aggregate_inat.r - downloads inaturalist observations, will include code to aggregate these observations into counts-per-county and produce GPS coordinates for the cetnroids of the counties

north-american-data-analysis.R - organize nextstrain phylogeny + gps data

run_alr.r - estimate gps coordinates of ancestral sequences in a phylogeny based on time-scaled edges and gps-located tips

run_gp_continuous.r - estimate value of a continuous variable at arbitrary points on the globe based on observations of that variable at other points on the globe
