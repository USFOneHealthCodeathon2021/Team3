Regarding the FIPS format, (https://rdrr.io/cran/usmap/man/fips.html):
State and county FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) are two and five digit codes, respectively. They uniquely identify all states and counties within the United States. The first two digits of the five digit county codes correspond to the state that the county belongs to. FIPS codes also exist for US territories and minor outlying islands, though this package only provides information for the 50 US states (and their associated counties and census designated areas).
